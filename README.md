# bewatering
simple ESP32 Blynk project

started this project to make use of an accidentally wrongly purchased ESP32 nodeMCU.
there are several steps in this project, I'll make tags for each of them.
The goal is to water my plants on my balcony from the rainbarrel.
* DUMB
   define the app and start the project with an ESP32 and a motorcycle battery.
   define two pump outputs and a voltage input for the battery
   define the project on Blynk to control the pumps with an app
   define IFTTT hooks to control the pumps with google
   make use of frequent deep sleeps to preserve the battery
 * SMART (the moisture sensors arrived)
   add moisture sensing to the app
